# python-debug

For practice debugging in Python. Each file has one or more
code bugs for you to try to fix. Note that the bugs will never
(intentionally) be in the test code.

You can run a particular file with, for example:
```
python 01.py
```

Printing things is one way of debugging, you can see what data
is stored in certain variables, what functions are returning, if
a line of code is being reached, etc. 

Using a debugger (like pdb) lets you pause the code and step through
it line by line and can be extremely helpful.
